# About the project

This is a virtual keyboard that uses the webcam to detect the user's hand and track the movement of the fingers. The program uses the MediaPipe library to detect the hand landmarks and OpenCV to process the video feed. The user can type by putting the index and middle fingers toghether. The program will show 
the text on the screen. It works in real-time and can be used to type in any text editor.
